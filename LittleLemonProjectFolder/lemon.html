      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean
        restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist.
        The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and
        have a menu of 12â€“15 items that they rotate seasonally. The restaurant
        has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a
        popular place for a meal any time of the day. Little Lemon is owned by
        two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States
        to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu,
        Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy.
        Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to
        expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional
        cuisines from the Mediterranean region.
